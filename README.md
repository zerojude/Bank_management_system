# Bank Management System

# Description 

Concerning the Project The Bank Management System is built on the idea of keeping track of a customer's account information. The user may create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, check balance, examine all account holders' information, terminate an account, and edit an account here. This project includes all of the major elements of a banking system.


When it comes to the features of the Bank Management System, a user may open an account by giving the account holder's name, account number, and an initial deposit of 50 rupees. The user may then deposit and withdraw money simply by entering his or her account number, which the system will show, and then inputting an amount.


He or she can also do a balance inquiry, which will provide the account holder's name, account number type, and balance for a specified purpose. He or she can also search up a list of everyone who owns an account. Another benefit is that the user may cancel their account by entering their account number, as well as alter their account data and type if needed. The history of transactions is also available.

This project uses classes and file handling features of C++.using file streams to read and write the data in the files. In order to store all the userâ€™s data, an external file (DAT file) is created by the system, so every time we get into the system we can operate with the existing accounts. Bank Management System is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it. Bank Management System in C++ Programming with source code is free to download. Use for educational purposes only! This project provides the simplest system for managing banking system.
